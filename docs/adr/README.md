Kingshot Alliance is an enterprise modular monolith organized by explicit business domains. The canonical physical repository structure is defined by the implementation plan and ADR 0008.

Runtime PHP is owned by a canonical `app/Domain/<Domain>` module. Internal organization such as `Actions`, `Queries`, `Services`, `Models`, `Http`, `Enums`, and `ValueObjects` lives inside the owning domain rather than in parallel top-level application layers.

Domains should communicate through intentional public actions, queries, services, value objects, or events. A cross-domain dependency must be part of the other domain's supported contract rather than an accidental dependency on its persistence internals.
